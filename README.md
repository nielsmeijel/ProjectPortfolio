# Niels van Meijel Project Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio showcasing my projects! Here, you'll find a collection of some of the projects I've worked on, each one tailored to specific job roles. I've divided them into four categories: Data Engineering, Data Science, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning.

In the Data Engineering section, you'll see projects where I've worked with data pipelines, building and maintaining databases, ETL jobs, and data warehousing. In the Data Science section, I've focused on predictive modeling, clustering, and data visualization. The Data Analysis section showcases my skills in exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization. Finally, in the Machine Learning section, you'll find projects where I've built and deployed predictive models using various algorithms and techniques.

I hope this portfolio gives you a sense of my skills and passion for data. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or comments. Thank you for visiting!
